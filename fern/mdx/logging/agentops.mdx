## Setting up AgentOps with Superagent locally
<Callout>
You can create a user API key here: [app.agentops.ai/account](https://app.agentops.ai/account).
</Callout>
AgentOps is automatically configured once you set an API key in your `.env`. 
```
AGENTOPS_API_KEY=<YOUR_AGENTOPS_API_KEY>
AGENTOPS_ORG_KEY=<YOUR_ORG_KEY>

Superagent provides a default `AGENTOPS_ORG_KEY` that grants users access to specialized analytics features. However, you may also remove it or replace it with your own.
