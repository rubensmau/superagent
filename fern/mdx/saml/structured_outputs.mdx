Besides SDK we support setting output schemas as well. In this page we will show you how to set output schema for forcing LLM to generate output in a specific format.
Output schema is a JSON object that describes the structure of the output. This can be anything from a simple JSON object to a complex nested structure.


Note: We will use `Scraper` tool in our examples. You can get the API Key from [ScrapingBee's website](https://www.scrapingbee.com/)

### Natural Language Schema
This is a simple and intuitive way to define the output schema. It can be anything.

```yaml
workflows:
  - anthropic:
      llm: claude-3-haiku-20240307
      name: Structured Assistant
      tools:
        - scraper:
            name: browser
            use_for: searching the internet
            metadata:
              apiKey:  <YOUR_SCRAPINGBEE_API_KEY>
      prompt: You're a helpful assistant.
      output_schema: |-
        [
          {
           product_url: Product URL that links to the Amazon page
           product_name: Name of the product
           product_price: Price of the product in U.S dollars
          }
        ]
```


### JSON Schema
JSON schema is more powerful than natural language schema. It allows you to define the output schema in a more structured way.

```yaml
workflows:
  - anthropic:
      llm: claude-3-haiku-20240307
      name: Structured Assistant
      tools:
        - scraper:
            name: browser
            use_for: searching the internet
            metadata:
              apiKey: <YOUR_SCRAPINGBEE_API_KEY>
      prompt: You're a helpful assistant.
      output_schema:
        type: array
        items:
          type: object
          required:
            - product_url
            - product_name
            - product_price
          properties:
            product_url:
              type: string
            product_name:
              type: string
            product_price:
              type: number
              description: the price of the product in U.S dollars
```

For example, you can ask for `I need a list of books about programming from Amazon.`. The scraper tool will scrape the data from Amazon's website and return the data in the format you have defined in the output schema.
