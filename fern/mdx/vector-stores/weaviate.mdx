## Setting up weaviate with Docker

<Callout intent="warn">
For quickly trying out weaviate with Superagent, a basic docker compose example is provided in the folder `libs/.docker/external/vector-store/weaviate/`
For a production setup refer to the [official documentation](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/installation/docker-compose) on self hosting weaviate.
</Callout>
<br/>

### Run weaviate with docker compose

1. `cd` into the weaviate example folder

    ``` bash
    cd libs/.docker/external/vector-store/weaviate/
    ```

2. Copy the `.env.example` file into a `.env` file

    ``` bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

3. For quickly trying out weaviate you can keep the default environment variables, though it is advised to review them and change the `AUTHENTICATION_APIKEY_ALLOWED_KEYS` to a more secure secret passkey, and possibly disable `AUTHENTICATION_ANONYMOUS_ACCESS_ENABLED` to disable access to the API in the browser.

4. Start weaviate with docker compose using the provided `run.sh` script in the same folder.

   ``` bash
   ./run.sh
   ```

5. You can access the weaviate API in the browser to confirm the service is up.

    [http://localhost:8082](http://localhost:8082) or [http://weaviate:8082](http://weaviate:8082) if you have added the following to your `hosts` file.

    ``` bash
    # hosts file
    127.0.0.1   weaviate
    ```

6. Enter the values in the superagent docker `.env` file

    ``` bash
    # libs/.docker/.env
    VECTORSTORE=weaviate
    WEAVIATE_API_KEY=<KEY SET IN WEAVIATE .env AUTHENTICATION_APIKEY_ALLOWED_KEYS>
    WEAVIATE_INDEX=superagent
    WEAVIATE_URL=http://weaviate:8082
    
    ```

### Weaviate container logs

``` bash
docker logs weaviate -f
```

### Stop weaviate

Use the provided `stop.sh` script to stop running services for weaviate

``` bash
# libs/.docker/external/vector-store/weaviate
./stop.sh
```

### Uninstall weaviate

Use the provided `uninstall.sh` script to remove the running services for weaviate

``` bash
# libs/.docker/external/observabillity/weaviate

## Setting up weaviate Cloud

Alternatively you can use the cloud hosted version of weaviate.

1. Sign up for an account here [https://console.weaviate.cloud/](https://console.weaviate.cloud/)
2. Create a new cluster named `superagent`
3. Once the cluster has deployed, expand the cluster `Details` and under `Authentication` click `API Keys` - copy your key.
4. Enter the values in the superagent docker `.env` file, paste the key in the variable `WEAVIATE_API_KEY`.
5. Grab the `Cluster Url`, e.g `https://superagent-1234567.weaviate.network` - enter the Cluster Url in the `WEAVIATE_URL` var.

    ``` bash
    # libs/.docker/.env
    VECTORSTORE=weaviate
    WEAVIATE_API_KEY=<API KEY FROM WEAVIATE>
    WEAVIATE_INDEX=superagent
    WEAVIATE_URL=<CLUSTER URL FROM WEAVIATE>

    ```
